# FosdemToGo

FosdemToGo is a little app to manage your FOSDEM talk schedule. It allows you
to get an overview of what talks are going to happen on which day and also to
bookmark specific talks. All this is done offline after you initially download
a talk schedule.

This all started primarily as an experiment to learn Swift und UIKit but it
quickly grew into something that I wanted to have for FOSDEM 2021. I hope you
find it useful too!

You can find a more detailed story about how this app came to be on

FosdemToGo is now **[available in the iOS AppStore][a]**!
